# Course Explorer (old, 2017)

This is an explorer built that showed CBOK mapping of a computer science degree. As it was built for a one-time use (an accreditation visit), it included a copy of the Veautiful scala.js UI code rather than importing it as a library.

Of interest in this repo, is that it models the units directly in Scala, so we could see what that looked like.
