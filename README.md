# The Coding Escape

This is an Hour-of-Code style outreach that I've run for Far Out Science in 2018 and 2019. It's also an example of something built using my Scala.js UI toolkit, [Veautiful](https://www.wbillingsley.com/veautiful)

You can play along with it live on [GitHub Pages](https://theintelligentbook.com/fos1_codingescape).

Amongst other things added in 2019:

* An updated version of my little blocks-language, Scatter!
* Cards of Doom, now playable!
* V-Slides - the logic that lays out the deck is now separated so I can also use it for Markdown-style slide decks (though here it's game-stages)
